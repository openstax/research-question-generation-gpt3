- generate.py is our method of pulling from OpenAI's API to generate text using GPT-3
  - "input" is the training data fed into the language model with an input at the end that you want to generate a question for
  - an example 5-shot input is given in the file in CTQA form, with an input at the end that should generate a missing question and answer
  - each piece of training data and the input should be seperated by empty lines and a '###' token as seen in the example
  - the user's unique OpenAI API key is needed to generate text
- In each folder there are .txt files that show what training data was used for each experiment
  - any text in parenthesis in these text files are not meant to be inputted into the language model, and are there for your reference only
  - the text in the parenthesis signify the size/length of the training data below, or describe how many "shots" it is at each point (ex: oneshot, fiveshot, etc.)
  - for all questions pulled from the Openstax Biology 2e textbook, the section they came from is given as well as the blooms level (difficulty level)
- the rest of the files in the folder are pickled files that contain results from each of the experiments
  - each pickled file is named to describe what experiment it contains
  - each name ends in t and a number, this number corresponds to the question target pair that was inputted for these results
  - these question target pairs can be found in QT_pairs.txt, where each number in parenthesis defines the target and corresponding context
